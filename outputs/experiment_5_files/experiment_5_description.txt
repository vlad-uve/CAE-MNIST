Experiment 5: effect of activation function
Three alternative settings:
experiment_5_model_1: activation function = Leaky ReLU, leaky_relu_slope = 1e-2
experiment_5_model_2: activation function = Leaky ReLU, leaky_relu_slope = 1e-1
experiment_5_model_3: activation function = Leaky ReLU, leaky_relu_slope = 2e-1
Other parameters are the same as for the base line model
